# Ps2TtkCalculator

Ps2TtkCalculator is a web-based port/re-write of [my PS2 TTK Calculator WPF app](https://github.com/B4rrCH/PS2_TTK_Calculator/). 

The current state can be found at https://b4rrch.github.io/Ps2TtkCalculator/.

(Planned) features are:    
  - [x] Auto deploy to github pages.
  - [x] to calculate the TTK distribution based on
    - [x] weapon stats gotten from the [Daybreak Games Census API](http://census.daybreakgames.com/),
    - [x] the target's loadout (nanoweave armor, HA shields, health pool, symbiote),
    - [x] headshot rate, accuracy and range,
  - [x] and calculating the win probabilites in engagements.
